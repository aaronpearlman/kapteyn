Kapteyn Package 2.0.2 Release

We are pleased to announce the release of version 2.0.2 of the Kapteyn Package.

The Kapteyn Package is a collection of Python modules developed by the
computer group of the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, University of
Groningen, The Netherlands. 

Some of the package's features:

- The handling of spatial and spectral coordinates, WCS projections and
  transformations between different sky systems.  Spectral translations
  (e.g., between frequencies and velocities) are supported and also mixed
  coordinates. For WCS, Dr. Mark Calabretta's WCSLIB is used.

- Versatile tools for writing small and dedicated applications for the
  inspection of FITS headers, the extraction and display of (FITS) data,
  interactive inspection of this data and for the creation
  of plots with world coordinate information.

- Utilities for use with Matplotlib such as obtaining coordinate
  information from plots, interactively modifiable colormaps and timer
  events; tools for parsing and interpreting coordinate information
  entered by the user. 

- A class for the efficient reading, writing and manipulating simple
  table-like structures in text files. 

Currently supported architectures are Linux, Apple Mac OS X and
Microsoft Windows.
