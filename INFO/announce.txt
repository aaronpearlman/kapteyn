Kapteyn Package 2.2 released


We would like to announce the release of version 2.2 of the Kapteyn
Package, a collection of Python modules developed by the computer group
of the Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen, The
Netherlands. 


New features:

- A class for solving least-squares problems using the Levenberg-Marquardt
  technique. It is based on the implementation in C of Craig Markwardtâ€™s
  MPFIT routines.

- many smaller improvements and some bugfixes.


Other features:

- Classes for the handling of spatial and spectral coordinates, WCS
  projections and transformations between different sky systems.
  For WCS, Dr. Mark Calabretta's WCSLIB 4.13.3 is used. WCSLIB is
  integrated in the package and need not be installed separately.

- Tools for writing small applications for the display and interactive
  inspection of (FITS) data and for the creation of plots with world
  coordinate information, including all-sky plots. A class for plotting
  shapes like ellipses, rectangles and regular polygons. Support for
  RGB-coded images.

- Utilities for use with Matplotlib such as obtaining coordinate
  information from plots and interactively modifiable colormaps.

- A class for the efficient reading, writing and manipulating of simple
  table-like structures in text files. 

- A function for estimating gaussian components in a profile. These
  estimates could subsequently be used as initial estimates for a least
  squares fit. 


Currently supported architectures are Linux, Apple Mac OS X and
Microsoft Windows.
