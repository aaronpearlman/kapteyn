Module interpolation
====================

This module has been copied from SciPy
(`scipy.ndimage.interpolation <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ndimage.html#module-scipy.ndimage.interpolation>`_)
and is included in the Kapteyn Package for convenience reasons.
In this way users of the package do not need to have all of SciPy installed,
of which only the function :func:`map_coordinates()` is currently used.
