The unpacked and unmodified WCSLIB distribution is placed in this directory.
The Kapteyn Package's setup.py script uses its sources when building the
kapteyn.wcs module. When a new version of WCSLIB is released, the old one
can be removed and replaced by the new one. Then the variable 'wcslib_dir'
in the setup.py script may have to be changed.
