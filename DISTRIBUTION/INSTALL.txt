Installation Instructions
=========================

Requirements for installing this package are a suitable
C compiler, wcslib and numpy.

There are three installation options:

1. To install the package, run the setup.py script in this
   directory as follows:

      python setup.py install

   This will install the package into your Python system.

2. If you prefer not to modify your Python installation,
   create a directory under which to install the package
   e.g., mydir. Then install as follows:

      python setup.py install --install-lib mydir

   To use the package you then need to include mydir in
   your PYTHONPATH.

3. If you want to use this package only for GIPSY, you can
   install it as follows:

      python setup.py install --install-lib $gip_exe


Known Problem
=============

An often-encountered problem is that WCSLIB's default installation
procedure installs its lib/ and include/ directories under /usr/local/
while the system is not configured for this.  This can be fixed by
changing the system's configuration, e.g., by changing /etc/ld.so.conf,
or WCSLIB can be installed under /usr.  See the file INSTALL in WCSLIB's
distribution.
