Version 2.0.3 (in development)
==============================

* Class wcs.Projection:

  * added attribute *category*

  * fixed ZPN projection related problem in method *mixed()*

  * minimal FITS headers are now accepted

* Module maputils:

  * added new class *Skypolygon* for plotting shapes like ellipses,
    rectangles and regular polygons. For these shapes
    angles and distances along a great circle are preserved.
    This class can be used for example to draw footprints on all-sky
    plots or a beam to show the resolution of an instrument.

  * improved position information in toolbar.  Message format can be
    changed by user/programmer. 
  
  * support for RGB images. RGB values are displayed in message toolbar.
  
  * class *FITSimage*: improved versions of header2classic() and
    reproject_to() methods;
    new slice2world method prints information about
    slice positions (annotate 2d maps from a 3d data cube).

* Module mplutil:

  * work-around for special keys which are defined in matplotlib's GTKAgg
    backend but 'missing' from the Qt4Agg backend.
    The following keys are made available: 'pageup', 'pagedown',
    'left', 'right', 'up', 'down', 'home', 'end'.

* Module positions:

  * units 1/...  and /...  also recognized.  Can be used for spectral
    translations that transform to e.g.  AWAV. 

* Module shapes:

  * messages for toolbar improved.
  
  * changed conversion routine to support shapes on maps with only one
    spatial axis (e.g.  position-velocity maps).
    
  * GUI improved.
  
  * Improved writing shape data to file.

* Module wcsgrat:

  * fixed bug with precision in seconds.
  
* New module profiles:

  * added function *gauest()* for estimating gaussian components in
    a profile. These estimates can e.g. subsequently be used as initial
    estimates for a least squares fit.

* WCSLIB: changed to version 4.6 (from 4.5)


Version 2.0.2 (Sep 16, 2010)
============================

* Class wcs.Projection:

  * allow for FITS headers that incorrectly represent EQUINOX as a string

  * added support for AIPS keyword VELREF

* Function mplutil.gipsy_connect() connects GIPSY keyword events
  to Matplotlib event loop.

* Added Microsoft Windows support.


Version 2.0.1 (Aug 11, 2010)
============================

* WCSLIB 4.5 included in distribution so
  it does not need to be separately installed anymore.

Version 2.0 (Jul 16, 2010)
==========================

* Class wcs.Projection:

  * added method *inside()*.

Version 1.9.2 (Jul 12, 2010)
============================

* Function wcs.coordmap(): added arguments *dst_shape*, *dst_offset*
  and *src_offset*.

* Class wcs.Projection:

  * fixed bug in class WrappedHeader.

  * allow for WSRT files with topocentric frequencies (via class WrappedHeader)

  * added attribute *altspecarg*.

* Added modules *rulers* and *shapes*.

* Included SciPy modules *filters* and *interpolation*. The latter was slightly
  modified.


Version 1.9.1 (Feb 25, 2010)
============================

* Class wcs.Projection:

  * added attribute *euler*.

  * fixed bug in method *mixed()*

* Class mplutil.VariableColormap:

  * added NumPy array as possible source.

  * added method *set_length()*



Version 1.9 (Jan 16, 2010)
==========================

* First public release.
